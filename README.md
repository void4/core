# rarVM (recursive, resource aware Virtual Machine)

(adapted to Python 3)

Install dependencies with:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Execute with

`python run.et et/macro.et`

The high level language has the .et filetype, but its just a text file.

I call it *Entish* because the runtime structures you can produce with it are recursive and hierarchical, like a tree.
