Explanation of terminal output:
1. Process state
2. Remaining steps
3. Remaining memory
4. Current instruction
<-|(1) NORMAL¦(2) 975¦(3) 1001¦ (4) PUSH|

Processes can be sandboxed recursively, since the language
is single-threaded and deterministic the runtime state is
always a chain of nested processes. Example:
<-|NORMAL¦966¦1007¦RUN|<-|NORMAL¦49¦49¦MEMORYLEN|
